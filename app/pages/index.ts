// For Next.js App Router, individual page components are defined in their respective
// directories with page.tsx files.
// This index file serves primarily for type exports and organization.

// In a traditional Next.js Pages Router, you would export page components here.
// With App Router, this file can be used to re-export utility functions, types,
// or configurations related to pages.
